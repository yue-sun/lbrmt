## üåä What is LBRMT?

The LBRMT is designed to simulate fluid‚Äìstructure interaction (FSI).

As an Eulerian method, it only requires one fixed computational grid for both solids and fluids. The LBRMT consists of two integral parts: the first involves an Eulerian representation of finite-strain solids, and the second involves a boundary condition for moving deformable interfaces across different densities.
We use the reference map technique (RMT) to model solid large deformation. Additionally, we have developed a new lattice Boltzmann (LB) boundary condition called "smooth flux correction" to model the interfaces between squishy solids and fluids.

The LBRMT is suitable for parallelization and capturing the multi-body contact of hundreds of solids. It can simulate soft solids rotating, settling, floating, and mixing. We believe it could be a promising tool for simulating the spatiotemporal patterns of active matter and studying both the collective and individual dynamics of biological systems.


## üåü Why LBRMT?

- **_One grid to run them all_**: no extra meshes or remeshing needed to track solids
- **_From Boltzmann to lattice Boltzmann_**: easy to parallelize for fluid simulation
- **_The more, the merrier_**: efficient to model hundreds of soft solids

## üíª How to use LBRMT?

The code is written in C++ and uses the OpenMP library for multithreading. It has been tested on Linux and MacOS (GCC installed via Homebrew). The following compiling instructions assume that you have a working C++ environment with OpenMP on your computer. All commands are in the terminal.

### ‚è¨ Install and compile

First, navigate to the directory that you want to install `LBRMT` then clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/yue-sun/lbrmt.git
```
Second, navigate into `lbrmt` and compile:
```shell
cd lbrmt
make
```
Now your executables should be in the `build/` and ready to run!
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **GCC**: If you're a Mac user, make sure your `GCC` is in `/opt/homebrew/bin/gcc` when you type `which gcc`. Also, adjust the `GCC` version in the `Makefile` according to your `GCC` version.

### üÜí Examples

After successfully compiling the code, you should have the following directories within `lbrmt/`:
```shell
lbrmt
‚îÇ   README.md
‚îÇ   Makefile
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄbuild # simulation executables (autogenerated)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   sim_fsi    # exec for lid-driven cavity and settling/floating
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   sim_rotate # exec for rotating
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄsim_mix    # exec for mixing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄobjs  # objects and linker files (autogenerated)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄsrc   # code source files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄsims  # examples (config files, simulation results also saved here)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   fsi_ldc.cfg     # lid-driven cavity with a soft solid
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   fsi_rotate.cfg  # 4 anchored rotors rotating
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   fsi_settle.cfg  # 1 solid settling or floating
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄfsi_mix.cfg     # 100 solids mixing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄutils # scripts for visualization and data processing
```

The benchmark example (Section 4.1) of a soft solid in lid-driven cavity can be run using two threads with the following command:
```shell
OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 build/sim_fsi sims/fsi_ldc.cfg
```
The config file specifies the simulation parameters, such as domain size, geometric and material properties for the solid, and physical properties for the fluid. The code will create a directory called `fsi_ldc.out` for the simulation output under the `sims/` directory. To process the output data, navigate to the `utils` directory and there are Python scripts and notebooks to postprocess for data analysis and visualization.

To modify the simulation domain size or solid/fluid properties, modify the `*.cfg` files.

To run other examples, follow the similar command structure:
```shell
OMP_NUM_THREADS=(num_threads) build/(your_exec) sims/(your_sim).cfg
```
